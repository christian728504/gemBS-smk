If you use this workflow in a paper, don't forget to give credits to the authors by citing the URL of this repository or its DOI.

## Deployment options

To run the workflow from command line, change the working directory.

```bash
cd path/to/snakemake-workflow-name
```

Adjust options in the default config file `config/config.yml`.
Before running the complete workflow, you can perform a dry run using:

```bash
snakemake --dry-run
```

To run the workflow with test files using **conda**:

```bash
snakemake --cores 2 --sdm conda --directory .test
```

To run the workflow with **apptainer** / **singularity**, add a link to a container registry in the `Snakefile`, for example `container: "oras://ghcr.io/<user>/<repository>:<version>"` for Github's container registry.
Run the workflow with:

```bash
snakemake --cores 2 --sdm conda apptainer --directory .test
```

## TODO

- [ ] Update the prepare and index rule to accept a tar.gz file, to initialize the pipeline (effectively skipping this lenght step)
- [ ] SLURM support
  - [ ] Docker environment
  - [ ] Testing (does gemBS work if distributed across SLURM nodes?)
  - [ ] Make average coverage json (mapping qc) readable with proper indentation
  - [ ]
